              <p>
                In the month that the first pictures from the James Webb Space Telescope is finally released, technology has indeed taken the center stage. The future is here. 
             
                  <br>
                 This sums up the agreement in the room on this occasion of the live webinar organised by CPF with insights from Bluebow research. The much attended event drew participants from across the globe. There was over a hundred
                 participants from different countries such as Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana, U.K and the U.S. The record attendance and broad spectrum of interested groups coming together shows that there is a general consensus on the need for a critical and rapid transformation of the workforce in general and the workplace in particular.


                 <br>
                 Opening the section Chris Philip, MP and U.K.'s Minister for Tech and Digital Economy enumerated the various Government schemes and legislations lined up to accelerate the digital transformation of the country. The levelling up agenda is also an Agenda for bridging the Tech divide it would seem.

                <br>
                 Mr Lance P Austen, Chairman South Hams District Council reiterated commitment of his administration and local authority to empower and widen access to tech to all members of the community.
                 Mr. O'tega Temienor of Bluebow advocated for a fair playing field for women and persons coming from disadvantaged backgrounds. He enumerated several research his firm has conducted that showcases inequalities in the representation of women occupying positions within the tech space. He also addressed concerns of scope and opportunities available for people from developing countries. 
                 A glance at Bluebow's website captures these cardinal points.
