                A gentleman named by residents as Fred Nyarko, believed to be 28years of age has been forcefully taken by unidentified men in uniform on Sunday at about 11am.
                 
                According to eye witnesses, he , together with 3 of his friends were going home after playing football when a black tainted V8 pulled up and two men in what could be described as police uniforms pulled guns. 
                A third man in the vehicle pointed out Fred Nyarko. Fred was pulled into the car and the perpetrators sped off. 
                
                It is not clear wether the said abductors work for any of the security agencies. Witnesses say they did not identify themselves nor did they give any reasons for their action.
                The community is in a state of shock and all efforts are been made to establish the whereabout of the young man. 
                This is a developing story, stay tuned for updates.
