              <p>
                Before I turned 10 years I had angelic encounters. 
                 Of one I was told of the events of the current pandemic, even the wearing of masks. But I would touch on the other encounter. 
                  <br>
                 On this occasion appearing in the form of a man, the angel spoke over me and explained that some people were going to try to harm me, but I should be rest assured that they cannot touch me.
                 <br>
                 Not everyone had those rare encounters that put a hedge around them in the beginning.

                 I am sharing this today, but some people who became victims of enchantments, spells and foundation demands have not survived to be able to tell their stories. 
                <br>
                 It is not great that a tongue speaking, miracle working, vision seeing christian would fall victim to ungodly family pattens and unsolicited suffering.

                      <p>because 
                        a christian without a clean break from their ancient traditional past is practicing bigamy...</p>
