            <p class="home-text">Welcome!!! 
                WHW is a christian book. It channel concepts of positivity and self worth.
                The author has been fair to share perspective on how he also dealt with
                evil. Although he embraces and actually practice the concept of affirmations, self-fulling prophecies and positive confessions,
                he also recognizes that when Esther said "if I die, I die" she did not end up dying. That may not have been an acceptable affirmation, yet she triumphed.
                 It is the author's understanding therefore that, it may not so much be what one affirms or does not affirm. There are also powers behind 
                the scene in some situations, and such should be accounted for.

            <h2 class="Abc">ABC</h2>
            <p>The principles elaborated in this book could be summed as ABC! A stands for Ambition. B stands for Balance and C stands for Character.
            The intentional and appropriate mix of these  ingredients of life's recipe would serve one's soul a timeless buffet that satisfies, from generation to generation.
            The strategy adapted in pursuance of one's ambitions should be carved in such a manner that other critical aspects of their life endeavors (health, family and relationships) do not suffer needlessly.
            Be moderate in thought and perspective, for there is always the other side of the pie.
            In all of this, purpose to practice good character both in word and in deed. When it gets tough, how/where do you stand?</p>

            <h3 class="story"> True Story of The Author</h3> 
            <p> The author has survived several attempts to circumvert his destiny and purpose in life. His unique journey of triumph is what actually inspires this book. In undergrad school University of Ghana, he sat
                an entrance exam to study Medicine.
                Fatigued by the all night of study prior, he woke just within time and hurried to the exam center leaving behind his student I.D. card.
                The invigilator would determine not to corroborate his identity from known colleague in the room, and would not allow him to sit the exam.
                So he missed Medical School!
                The subject of identity would later become one of his favorite concepts.
                In the Bible account of creation in the book of Genesis, God created man in His own image.
                The serpent offered man a deal, to become like God if he ate.
                Guess what, man was already like God, created in His image and likeness!
                Friends it has always been a battle about identity, even right from the beginning.
